# Fasih Platform
## An Arabic Digital Platform Supporting Children with Speech Disorders

## Project Overview
Fasih is an Arabic digital remote platform designed to support children with speech and language disorders. The platform provides a secure and interactive environment that integrates assessment, therapeutic training, and follow-up, enabling speech therapy specialists and parents to monitor a child’s progress effectively.

The platform focuses on delivering age-appropriate Arabic speech therapy content, reducing time and location barriers, and improving access to speech therapy services.

## Problem
Speech and language disorders are common challenges among children, as they directly affect their ability to communicate, learn, and engage in social interactions. One of the major issues in speech therapy is the lack of continuous follow-up outside clinical sessions, which can weaken the child’s progress and slow down improvement.

In addition, there is a noticeable shortage of specialized Arabic digital content in the field of speech therapy, along with difficulties faced by parents in accessing regular therapy services due to time and location constraints.

## Solution
Fasih was developed as an Arabic remote digital platform to support children with speech and language disorders by providing an interactive and secure therapeutic environment. The platform integrates initial assessment by speech therapy specialists, structured training programs, and continuous therapeutic follow-up.

Fasih enables parents and specialists to monitor the child’s progress through therapeutic sessions, audio and video recordings, and specialist notes, while offering age-appropriate training content tailored to each child’s needs. By reducing time and location barriers and enhancing continuity of care, Fasih contributes to improving children’s speech and communication skills and increasing their self-confidence.
